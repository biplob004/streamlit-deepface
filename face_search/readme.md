# ðŸŽ­ Facial Matching Application

This application uses the [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) library to analyze facial features and find matching images from a specified directory. Users can upload an image and select a model for verification, allowing for a robust facial matching experience.

## Features

- Upload images in various formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP).
- Choose from multiple facial recognition models.
- Set a matching threshold for image verification.
- Display matching images in a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web application framework.
- [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) for facial recognition.
- [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for image processing.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation.
